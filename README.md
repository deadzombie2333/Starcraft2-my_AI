# Starcraft2-my_AI
simple AI for starcraft 2 minigame based on pysc2

In this small project, two mini games are considered for now. One is defeat zerglings and banelings and the other is build marine. This two mini games, on my opinion, is good representative of tactic part and strategy part of Starcraft 2. 

Tactic part of Starcraft 2 works on winning a local battle versus enemy use limited amount of army. Key to this local victory is based on optimal use of friendly unit advantage such as longer attack range, higher moving speed, higher damage versus specific unit etc. It is most of time refer to as “Micro” in Starcraft 2. Strategy part of Starcraft 2 works on winning in a “bigger picture”. By optimal design of building order to possess advantage in army size or dominance in army technique (such as use banshee, a high damage anti-ground unit versus roach, a ground unit with no anti-air). This part can be refer to as “Macro” in Starcraft 2.

In my project, I attempt to design a neural network based agent for both minigame.  The purpose of this project include: attempt to design an artificial neural network in real application, practice python coding. Goal of this project is, for both minigame, achieve a higher score in both minigame and ultimately, design a neural network based agent that performs as good as human player.

This project is built on python 3.6.1 and numpy. During my coding, I referred to the project by https://github.com/chris-chris/pysc2-examples and https://github.com/skjb/pysc2-tutorial.
